# axios-example

axios provides an easy way to send HTTP requests like what the `request` module does.

The difference between axios and request is that axios supports ES6 Promise natively.
However, request requires you to install an additional module to do that.

## Installation :

Just type the following command to install it.
```bash
yarn add axios
// or
npm install axios --save
```
